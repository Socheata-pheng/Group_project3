            <h2>A caring home needed</h2>
            <h5><p>
                When considering adoption, it's essential to select a pet that matches your lifestyle and preferences.<br>
                Additionally, consider whether you want a dog, cat, or another type of pet.<br>
                Our Pawties are in need of a caring home and a responsible owner. <br>
                Pawties can sometimes be stray, abandoned, abused by their last owners.<br>
                We are looking for a dedicated and responsible owner to help look after them.<br>
                We are always in need of people who are willing
                to foster a cat or dog until they could find a permanent home. <br>
                If you are interested in being a foster, feel free to contact us and let us know.<br>
