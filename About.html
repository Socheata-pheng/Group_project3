        <h5>We started our journey as a small group of passionate individuals with an aim to make a difference for animals in need.<br>
        Before we started our work as a group we had our own dedication and condolence for those stray animal which urgently need helps.<br>
        By working individually we found many obstacles that leads to a slower actions in order to rescue those animal.<br>
         So, we made a page on social 
        media looking for others individuals who had passion and aim like us to join our team. <br> By doing so, we found our 4 passionate ladies who 
        has the same concern as our team. <br>In our 3 years of running Pawsome and Purrfect family meet our team below!

            <p>This event is held every Sunday at the end of the month. We held this event until today since it work
            really well. We accept every type of donation everyday until the end of the month,
            we will ask the donators to come with us, visiting pagodas and feed those strays.
            The purpose is to making sure that all the donated money is benefited to the animal
            Plus, the donators will experience the feeling to feed animal and see their current condition.
            Apart from going to pagoda we also use the fund to support other animal in our shelter.

                <p>This events was held since the beginning of out Paws family. We creat this event to promote our welfare
                    as well as to maintaing our situation at the moment. At the time, this campaign was not really succeed 
                    because not many people know our welfare and believe in us. But after our second launced of this events people
                    started to know us until now. And we already launched this events 3 times already each year of our anniversary of our welfare.

                <h2>Kandal Campaing</h2>
                <p>We are planning to launch a campaing at 2 places in Kandal province at the end of this year.
                    Our purpose to Kandal province is to implement the knowledge of animal welfare and vaccinated them.
                    First place is at a district called Ang Snoul and another one will be held at Ponhea Leue district. 
                    At both place we will help our campaign in 2 pagodas since, we thought that only the pagoda would open to 
                    public. Additionally, we think only going to
                    the acual place like this that we could educate them to stop trading those animal and serve them as food. 
                     If they don't provide home or feed them but at least they shouldn't
                    hate, kill or cursed it. Hope to see y'all engage with us in our campaign 
                to Kandal province next month. For more information <a href="Contact.html"> Contact</a> us.              </p>
